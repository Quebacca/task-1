                <h2>Dancing</h2>
                <p> Dance is my favourite hobby and one of the things in life that I thoroughly enjoy. Dance isn't also just about going through movements, it provides important life lessons like resilience and time management. </p>

                <h2>The Genre's of Dance</h2>
                <p>There are many genre's in dance. These are the ones that my studio focuses on. 
                    <strong>Ballet:</strong> Ballet is mandatory for our studio as it is essential for strength, flexibility, and discipline. It also correlates into other genre's, which is why it is so important.  
                    <strong>Contemporary:</strong> Contemporary mainly focuses on going off of your center. There are no limitations to how you move, but generally, it is just moving freely with a theme or idea.  
                    <strong>Jazz:</strong> Jazz is all about being powerful. We focus on kicks, turns, and leaps, which help build strength and benefit other styles.  
                    <strong>Tap:</strong> Tap is actually my favorite because I am very good at it, and it sounds very nice. You just tap with your feet and create rhythms with your tap shoes. Definitely recommend it.  
                    <strong>Musical Theatre:</strong> We usually focus on building characters in Musical Theatre. The dancing is very easy, but the characters make it challenging.  
                    <strong>Tumbling:</strong> Tumbling is where we learn to do flips and other similar movements, essential for other genres as well.
